# FCC-HTML-project1

This was my first project after learning HTML and CSS from freecodecamp back in 2020. Only used basic HTML and CSS to build dropshipping page. 

[Here](https://codepen.io/pulakdroy/pens/public?cursor=ZD0wJm89MSZwPTEmdj01MjY1MjAxMg==) are some of my early works that I did after while learning in freecodecamp.
